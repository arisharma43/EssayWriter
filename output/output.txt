I grew up on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. As a child, I loved going to the beach and swimming in the ocean. I also loved hiking and exploring the different areas of the island. I was lucky to grow up in such a beautiful place.

The people of Hawaii are also very friendly and welcoming. I remember always feeling welcome whenever I would go somewhere new. Everyone was always willing to help me if I needed it. I think this made me grow up to be a more compassionate person.

Growing up in Hawaii was an amazing experience. I am so grateful to have been able to grow up in such a beautiful and welcoming place.
